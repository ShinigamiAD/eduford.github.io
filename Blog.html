            <h2>Our Certificates & Online Programs for 2022</h2>
            <p>Currently, there isn’t an internationally recognized university ranking featuring institutions that offer online degrees. However, some of the universities featured in regular university rankings do offer a lot of great online study options.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You don't need to quit your job or move to a new city to earn a top university degree. Learn from the same professors and graduate with a high-value credential from the same university. Choose from a wide variety of online Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in some of today’s most in-demand fields.</p>
            <br>
            <p>DCU currently delivers more than 200 programmes through five faculties: DCU’s Institute of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Science and Health, Engineering and Computing and DCU Business School. DCU has a proud 30-year history of delivering distance and online higher education through DCU Connected and it is home to the National Institute of Digital Learning. The University is a member of both the International Council for Open and Distance Education and European Association of Distance Teaching Universities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Research is a high priority at DCU, with the focus on global grand challenges, such as healthcare needs, sustainable development, multicultural societies, and conflict resolution. DCU’s enterprise focus is reflected in its strong industry-academic collaborations and successful execution of licences arising from its intellectual property portfolio. DCU’s excellence is recognised internationally and it is ranked in Times Higher Education’s ‘Top 100 under 50’. DCU is also the only Irish university to be represented in the prestigious European university network, The European Consortium of Innovative Universities.</p>
